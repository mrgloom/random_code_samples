bce loss :
Pipeline: mask in range [0,1] as single pixel + sigmoid + bce loss -> Fail
Pipeline: mask in range [0,1] as blob + sigmoid + bce loss -> Ok

weighted bce loss :
Pipeline: mask in range [0,1] as single pixel + sigmoid + weighted bce loss -> Ok [Comment: converges not to single point but to blob]

Pipeline: mask in range [0,1] as single pixel + multiplier + linear activation + mae loss -> Fail
Pipeline: mask in range [0,1] as single pixel + multiplier + relu activation + mae loss -> Fail
Pipeline: mask in range [0,1] as single pixel + sigmoid activation + mae loss -> Fail
